        <h3>Turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka </h3>
        <p>Sea turtle hatcheries exist as an ex situ conservation tool in many countries (Shanker, 1994; Upm &
          Perhilitan, 1996; Chan, 2001; Shanker, 2003), including the southeastern coast of Sri Lanka (Hewavisenthi,
          1993; Tisdell and Wilson, 2005a). However, doubts have been raised about the effective contribution of
          hatcheries to the conservation of sea turtles (Hewavisenthi, 1993; Shanker & Pilcher, 2003). Tisdell and
          Wilson (2005a) modeled the role of tourism-based sea turtle hatcheries by combining economical and ecological
          parameters, and demonstrated that hatcheries can make a positive contribution to sea turtle conservation, but
          their effectiveness depends on their management.</p>
        <p>The first Sri Lankan sea turtle hatchery was established in 1956 at Yala National Park by the Wildlife and
          Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, a non-governmental organization for nature conservation. A second
          hatchery was established at Palatupana in 1969. Both hatcheries were opened with conservation, restoration and
          management of the sea turtles and their habitats in Sri Lanka as the main objectives. The number of hatcheries
          increased rapidly in the 1970’s, with as many as 23 additional hatcheries opening (Fernando, 1977). </p>

          <h2>The Importance of Turtle Hatcheries in Sea Turtle Conservation</h2>
          <p> The role of a Turtle Hatchery should be to patrol the beaches to prevent poaching. Instead, when eggs are
            stolen from the nests simply because Hatcheries are purchasing them - sometime outbidding each other, it
            encourages poachers to steal as many eggs as possible - even if the nests are not threatened. </p>

          <h2>Threats to turtles</h2>
          <p>Sea turtles are built to last. Equipped with unique body armor to protect them from their natural enemies,
            they have swum the seas since dinosaurs roamed the land. However, in recent history, rapidly increasing
            human populations have resulted in new and acute pressures, making sea turtle survival ever more difficult.
            Expert members of the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group have identified five major threats to sea
            turtles worldwide: fisheries bycatch, coastal development, pollution and pathogens, direct take, and climate
            change. Learn more about these threats and find out how you can help.</p>
